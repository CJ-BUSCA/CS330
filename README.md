How do I approach designing software?
The biggest approach I take to designing software is the practicality and I try to orient my goals to a specific function or objective. I want my product to be specific and measured by the standards that I had set for myself when I began designing the project. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I have no previous experience working in OpenGL, so this lead me to doing a lot of my own research. A lot of the reference material is extremely dated, which lead me to trying to implement my own solutions by looking at other resources online such as StackOverflow, where they give examples of how to create objects within 3D environments. My scene ended up being a little bit more complex than I thought, so my goal was to focus on the basics of my scene instead of trying to do anything too extravagant. 

Computational graphics can prove to be beneficial in the right expertise. For instance, you are developing a new 3D Game Engine that uses real-time physics, OpenGL and graphics simulations can prove useful. There is a lot of geometry involved in this area, and is a test to a programmer's computational skills.
